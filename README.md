Super Cool Coloring App is a react-based coloring application

## Developing

This app requires a recent version of node. There is no server, this is just used for development.

To get started:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

This will install dependencies and run the dev server. It will print a URL for you to go to. That's it.

## Review

Main branch builds are published to the pages link above.

For commits/MRs, you can browse to the artifacts. The `index.html` page will successfully open the application from that commit.

## Building

To create a production build:

```bash
npm run build
```

The output will be in the `build/` directory.
